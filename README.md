# PolishCalcANTLR
Using ANTLR to implement a reverse Polish calculator.
The ANTLR grammar is quite simple, but it should follow all of the neccesary requirements. The grammar follow correct mathematical order of precedence. Parenthasis, Exponents, Mupltiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.
Using the general layout of how tpyical mathimatical grammars are used. I have also created that using the ANTLR grammar syntax.
I Used intellij, since they have a built in plugin for ANTLR v4, which is what I had used.
